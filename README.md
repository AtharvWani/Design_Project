# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The goal is to classify text data (such as reviews, tweets, or comments) into categories like positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Leveraging the power of pre-trained transformer models, this project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to natural language understanding tasks with high accuracy.

# Key Features :-

Utilizes pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face Transformers.

Fine-tunes on a labeled sentiment dataset (e.g., IMDb, SST-2, or custom).

Includes data preprocessing, tokenization, training, and evaluation.

Outputs accuracy, loss plots, and confusion matrix for analysis.

Implemented in Python using PyTorch, Transformers, and scikit-learn.

# Use Cases :- 

Customer feedback analysis

Social media monitoring

Product or movie review classification

Real-time sentiment tracking
